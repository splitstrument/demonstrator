# Demonstrator

![ZHAW Logo](zhaw_logo.png)

Simple web tool that allows separating songs. Configured in `conf.yaml` by setting the temporary folder where songs are
saved and the folder containing trainings. Training names are taken from the configurations or the folder names.

## Models

The folder `models` contains the two final models we trained for easier access. `training_folder` in `conf.yaml` can be
pointed at that folder to get the same demonstrator as we run on the InES server.
